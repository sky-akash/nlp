**Course syllabus**

The lectures provide an in-depth introduction to the main research topics in the field of Deep Learning applied to Natural Language Processing. In addition to the lectures, there is a final project through which students will acquire the necessary skills to design, implement and understand the main neural network models for natural language, using Python and Pytorch.

**Prerequisites for admission**

Intermediate knowledge of Python. Basic knowledge of derivatives and understanding of matrix/vector notation and operations. Basics of probabilities and gaussian distributions.

**Teaching methods**

The course is given in the form of lectures with extensive use of examples and support materials such as Python notebooks. Slides and handouts are employed throughout the lectures and they are progressively published on the reference course website on the Ariel platform and on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/afflint/nlp).
Lecture attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly recommended.

**Assessment methods and Criteria**

Development of a project. The project topic has to be previously discussed with the lecturer. The project should demonstrate the comprehension of the lectures topics and the capability of proposing and motivating innovative solutions to specific research problems.
The project will be evaluated through a discussion with the lecturer about the project outcomes and the related topics. The evaluation will take into account both the project and the interview.
Using the SIFA service for participating in the examination is mandatory. After the registration to an examination on SIFA, the students are requested to contact the lecturer for scheduling the discussion.
